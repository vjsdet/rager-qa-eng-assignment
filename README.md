# Technical Assessment for QA Engineer at Ranger

## Overview

In this exercise, you will work with Playwright (written in TypeScript) to create and complete three automated tests for Wikipedia.

You’ll start by implementing a login test from scratch, then finish two existing tests that were partially generated using Ranger’s test recorder and code generation tool.

You have one hour to complete this exercise on your own. When the hour is up, your interviewer will rejoin the call to discuss your work. You’ll walk them through what you accomplished, highlight what went well, and note any improvements you would have made with additional time.

## Your Task

1. Implement a login test and capture the storage state so the remaining tests run as a logged in user
    - In `login.test.ts`, create a test that signs into Wikipedia
    - Create an account if you don't already have one
    - Add your sign in credentials to `.env`
2. Complete the Wikipedia search test
    - In `searchWikipedia.ts`, finish the existing test so that it correctly implements the test case in the file
3. Complete the Wikipedia home page actions test
    - In `wikipediaHomepageActions.ts`, finish the existing test so that it correctly implements the test case in the file

Each test file contains more detailed instructions.

After you finish all three tests, please come back to this file. Imagine Wikipedia is a Ranger customer, and these tests are part of their end-to-end test suite. Write a technical message to Wikipedia describing the updates you made to `searchWikipedia.ts` and `wikipediaHomepageActions.ts`—specifically, what changed and why.

## Setup

### Requirements

-   Node.js v22+
-   npm

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install
```

### Running Tests

#### Run all tests

There's a `test` script in `package.json` so you can do:

```bash
npm run test
```

#### Run a specific test

Add `.only` to the specific test you want to run in isolation in `all.test.ts` and then run the same command:

```bash
npm run test
```
